# Progress Log

Tracks milestone status, decisions, issues, and exact commands that worked.
See `docs/architecture.md` for the pipeline description and the Autoware
component reuse log.

## Status

| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| M0 — Environment verified | In progress |
| M1 — Procedural lunar terrain | Not started |
| M2 — Rover spawns and drives (teleop) | Not started |
| M3 — Localization | Not started |
| M4 — Autonomous navigation | Not started |
| M5 — Demo polish and packaging | Not started |

## Decisions

- **Repository strategy**: `regolith` stays a thin meta-repo (mirroring
  upstream Autoware's `.repos`-driven pattern) rather than importing the full
  `autowarefoundation/autoware` git history. It holds `regolith.repos`
  (pins `regolith.universe`), top-level docs, and `scripts/`. All package
  source — including `regolith_bringup` — lives in `regolith.universe` under
  `planetary/`, per the plan's own package table. Rationale: keeps demo
  packages, their launch files, and their cross-package dependencies in one
  repo, matching how autoware.universe/autoware_launch actually work upstream.
- Six placeholder packages that predated the milestone plan
  (`regolith_bringup`, `regolith_interfaces`, `regolith_localisation`,
  `regolith_navigation`, `regolith_perception`, `regolith_simulation` — empty
  `package.xml` stubs, no code) were removed from `regolith`'s `src/` for the
  reason above. Their layering concept is preserved as prose in
  `docs/architecture.md`.
- `regolith.universe` created as a genuine GitHub fork of
  `autowarefoundation/autoware_universe` (fork relationship + full history on
  `main` preserved; only `main` branch copied, not every upstream branch/tag).

## Environment

- Host: Windows 11 + NVIDIA GPU, WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS.
- RAM: 13 GB total — below the plan's 32 GB comfort threshold. Using
  `colcon build --parallel-workers 2` / `MAKEFLAGS=-j2` per the plan's
  fallback guidance rather than changing `.wslconfig`.
- ROS 2 Humble / Gazebo Harmonic / GPU rendering verification: not yet run.

## Issues encountered

- This Claude Code session runs as a background job with no attached TTY, so
  neither `sudo` nor `gh auth login`'s interactive prompts could be driven
  from here directly. Resolved by having the user configure passwordless
  `sudo` for their own account and complete GitHub's device-code auth flow
  (`gh auth login --web`) from their side.
- The Ubuntu 22.04 universe repo's `gh` package is a stale 2.4.0 (2022) build
  whose device-code flow tripped GitHub's rate limiter (`slow_down`). Fixed by
  installing the current `gh` release directly from GitHub's `.deb` releases
  instead of the (also 404ing) `cli.github.com` apt repo.
- `gh repo fork --org ... --fork-name regolith.universe` failed with a fine-
  grained PAT scoped only to the `Regolith-Project` org, since forking calls
  the API against the *source* repo (outside the token's scope). Forked
  manually via the GitHub web UI instead.
