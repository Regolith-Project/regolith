## Decisions

- **Repository strategy**: `regolith` stays a thin meta-repo (mirroring
  upstream Autoware's `.repos`-driven pattern) rather than importing the full
  `autowarefoundation/autoware` git history. It holds `regolith.repos`
  (pins `regolith.universe`), top-level docs, and `scripts/`. All package
  source — including `regolith_bringup` — lives in `regolith.universe` under
  `planetary/`, per the plan's own package table. Rationale: keeps demo
  packages, their launch files, and their cross-package dependencies in one
  repo, matching how autoware.universe/autoware_launch actually work upstream.
- Six placeholder packages that predated the milestone plan
  (`regolith_bringup`, `regolith_interfaces`, `regolith_localisation`,
  `regolith_navigation`, `regolith_perception`, `regolith_simulation` — empty
  `package.xml` stubs, no code) were removed from `regolith`'s `src/` for the
  reason above. Their layering concept is preserved as prose in
  `docs/architecture.md`.
- `regolith.universe` created as a genuine GitHub fork of
  `autowarefoundation/autoware_universe` (fork relationship + full history on
  `main` preserved; only `main` branch copied, not every upstream branch/tag).

## Environment

- Host: Windows 11, WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS. Hybrid AMD/NVIDIA laptop GPU
  (AMD Radeon integrated + NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 Laptop GPU discrete) — WSLg's
  D3D12 renderer defaults to the AMD adapter. Fixed by exporting
  `MESA_D3D12_DEFAULT_ADAPTER_NAME=NVIDIA` (added permanently to `~/.bashrc`),
  per the plan's WSL2 rendering fallback notes.
- RAM: 13 GB total — below the plan's 32 GB comfort threshold. Using
  `colcon build --parallel-workers 2` / `MAKEFLAGS=-j2` per the plan's
  fallback guidance rather than changing `.wslconfig`.

## M0 acceptance results

- `glxinfo -B` (with the adapter override): `Device: D3D12 (NVIDIA GeForce
  RTX 3050 Laptop GPU)` — confirmed NVIDIA, not llvmpipe.
- `gz sim shapes.sdf`: loads the Ogre2 GUI render engine, no errors/warnings
  beyond benign DART collision-geometry notices; screenshot confirms a
  correctly shaded, GPU-rendered 3D scene (not black) — see
  `docs/media/m0_gz_sim_gpu_render.png`. GUI process ran at ~125% CPU while
  rendering, consistent with active interactive rendering (Gazebo has no
  built-in FPS counter to log a number directly).
- ROS 2: `ros2 topic list` and a `demo_nodes_cpp talker` → `ros2 topic echo`
  round-trip both worked (`/chatter`, `/parameter_events`, `/rosout` present;
  received `data: 'Hello World: 26'`).
- Installed: `ros-humble-desktop` (includes RViz2), `gz-harmonic` (Gazebo Sim
  8.14.0), `ros-humble-ros-gzharmonic` (the Humble+Harmonic ros_gz pairing),
  `python3-colcon-common-extensions`, `python3-rosdep`, `python3-vcstool`,
  `ros-humble-teleop-twist-keyboard`, `ros-humble-robot-localization` (M3
  fallback per the plan).

## M1 acceptance results

- `ros2 launch regolith_bringup terrain_only.launch.py seed:=42` generates
  the world (heightmap, PBR textures, 4 rock mesh variants, 130 scattered
  rocks, manifest) and opens it in Gazebo. Screenshot:
  `docs/media/m1_lunar_terrain_seed42.png` — craters, rock scatter, long
  shadows from a 12° sun elevation, near-black sky all present.
- Determinism verified: two runs with `--seed 42` produced byte-identical
  `heightmap.png`; `--seed 7` produced a different heightmap, as expected.
- New package `regolith_terrain_gen` (`planetary/regolith_terrain_gen` in
  `regolith.universe`): fBm base (value noise, no external noise library) +
  power-law crater field (60 craters, 2-40 m diameters, bowl+rim profile) +
  1.5° regional slope, normalized to a 10 m height range on a 513x513
  heightmap over a 200x200 m world. 130 rocks (4 low-poly icosphere-derived
  variants) scattered outside a 12 m spawn-zone keep-out, seated on the
  actual terrain elevation at their position. Everything needed for M4's
  costmap (crater positions/depths, rock footprints) is recorded in
  `manifest.json`.
- New package `regolith_bringup` (`planetary/regolith_bringup`): first real
  content in the package the plan's table designates as the integration
  point; `terrain_only.launch.py` calls `regolith_terrain_gen` in-process via
  an `OpaqueFunction` (no shelling out / stdout-parsing needed) and hands the
  resulting world path to `ros_gz_sim`'s `gz_sim.launch.py`.
- `regolith.universe`'s existing ~500 MB / hundreds-of-packages tree was left
  untouched for this milestone — built with
  `colcon build --packages-select regolith_terrain_gen regolith_bringup`,
  so `rosdep install --from-paths src` failures on car-specific packages
  missing `tier4_*`/CUDA rosdep keys don't block M1. The `COLCON_IGNORE`
  stripping pass (plan section 4) is deferred to whichever milestone first
  needs a full-workspace build.

## M2 acceptance results

- New package `regolith_rover_description` (`planetary/regolith_rover_description`):
  Leo-Rover-sized 4-wheel skid-steer chassis (URDF/xacro), IMU, forward-tilted
  RGB camera, `gz-sim-diff-drive-system` plugin (multi-joint skid-steer mode),
  `JointStatePublisher` and `Imu` system plugins. `regolith_bringup` gained
  `teleop_demo.launch.py`: generates terrain, spawns the rover, bridges
  cmd_vel/odom/imu/camera/camera_info/joint_states/tf between ROS and Gazebo.
- `ros2 launch regolith_bringup teleop_demo.launch.py seed:=42` + manual
  `cmd_vel` Twist commands (standing in for `teleop_twist_keyboard`, which
  publishes the same topic/type): rover drives forward and turns repeatedly
  over the crater/rock field without flipping (verified via the ground-truth
  `/world/.../dynamic_pose/info` orientation quaternion staying at
  identity/pure-yaw, not tipping into roll/pitch) and without sinking (z
  stable at the resting height on repeated checks). `/odom`, `/imu`,
  `/camera/image`, `/camera/camera_info`, `/joint_states`, `/tf` all publish;
  RViz shows the robot model, TF frames, and a live camera feed
  (`docs/media/m2_rviz_camera_tf.png`).
- Stability tuning: widened track (0.36→0.46 m), lowered chassis height
  (0.14→0.11 m), increased wheel friction (μ 1.0→1.4), and capped
  `max_angular_velocity` at 0.3 rad/s (initially 1.2, then 0.6 - still
  flipped once under combined fast-forward+fast-turn before this final cut).

## Issues encountered

- This Claude Code session runs as a background job with no attached TTY, so
  neither `sudo` nor `gh auth login`'s interactive prompts could be driven
  from here directly. Resolved by having the user configure passwordless
  `sudo` for their own account and complete GitHub's device-code auth flow
  (`gh auth login --web`) from their side.
- The Ubuntu 22.04 universe repo's `gh` package is a stale 2.4.0 (2022) build
  whose device-code flow tripped GitHub's rate limiter (`slow_down`). Fixed by
  installing the current `gh` release directly from GitHub's `.deb` releases
  instead of the (also 404ing) `cli.github.com` apt repo.
- `gh repo fork --org ... --fork-name regolith.universe` failed with a fine-
  grained PAT scoped only to the `Regolith-Project` org, since forking calls
  the API against the *source* repo (outside the token's scope). Forked
  manually via the GitHub web UI instead.
- `pkill -f "gz sim"` (and similar) can match the invoking shell's own
  command line, since it literally contains the pattern text — killing the
  shell running the command before it can report anything. Use anchored
  patterns (`pkill -f "^gz sim"`) or `pgrep`/PID-based kills instead.
- Initial SDF had `<gravity>` nested inside `<physics>` — sdformat warns and
  silently ignores it there; gravity must be a direct child of `<world>`.
- Bowl-shaped craters viewed from a steep top-down angle with off-axis
  lighting read as domes to the human eye (verified against the raw
  heightmap data — the crater profile was always a genuine depression). This
  is the well-known "crater/dome" perceptual illusion seen in real lunar/Mars
  orbital imagery. Fixed by choosing a shallower camera pitch and a sun
  azimuth roughly aligned with the camera's viewing direction, rather than
  by changing the terrain data.
- **The M2 rover-on-terrain physics saga** (this consumed most of the M2
  session; recording it in full so it isn't re-litigated). Symptom: the
  rover's wheels spun at the commanded rate (confirmed via `/joint_states`)
  but the chassis never translated - or fell through everything, or the
  simulation appeared to "freeze" the rover solid - depending on the exact
  test. Confirmed real, separate findings along the way:
  - `gz sim -v 4` (debug verbosity, invisible at default `-v`) logs
    `"Heightmap/Mesh construction from an SDF has not been implemented yet
    for dartsim"`. Both the native `<heightmap>` collision geometry and
    generic `<mesh>` collision geometry are no-ops for dartsim in this
    gz-physics 7.8.0 install, reproduced identically under the `bullet` and
    `bullet-featherstone` engine plugins too (`--physics-engine
    gz-physics-bullet-plugin` / `-bullet-featherstone-plugin`). This part is
    a genuine, real engine limitation - box primitives are the fallback
    (`regolith_terrain_gen`'s `build_terrain_collision_boxes_sdf`), matching
    the plan's anticipated "static mesh instead of heightmap" fallback
    (substituting boxes since mesh doesn't work either).
  - What turned out to be **wrong, in order tried and discarded**: reducing
    box-grid resolution, splitting collision into separate `<model>`s vs.
    many `<collision>` elements on one link, removing rocks, removing rock
    *collision* specifically, changing gravity magnitude, disabling
    `allow_auto_disable`, adding an 8 s `TimerAction` delay before spawning,
    switching the ROS↔GZ `/pose` bridge from bidirectional to one-way,
    replicating the launch file's `GZ_SIM_SYSTEM_PLUGIN_PATH` env var
    manually. None of these were the actual bug; each seemed to "fix" or
    "reproduce" the symptom in some isolated test only because the tests
    differed in the one thing that actually mattered (below), which wasn't
    controlled for.
  - **Actual root cause**: the rover was being spawned at a fixed height
    (`z:=1.0`, later `z:=2.0`) that had nothing to do with the *local*
    terrain elevation at the spawn point. `build_terrain_collision_boxes_sdf`
    sizes each box to the average heightmap value in its footprint - at
    `grid_resolution=1` (one box for the whole world, an early attempt) that
    average can easily be several meters for a given seed, and even at finer
    resolutions the local elevation right at the nominal "origin" spawn
    point depends on the regional slope/base terrain for that seed. Spawning
    at a Z below the actual box surface means the rover starts *embedded in
    solid geometry*, and DART's response to that invalid initial state is
    unpredictable - a wheeled multi-body could look "frozen" (no visible
    integration), "falling through" (numerically unstable contact resolving
    away from the overlap in the wrong direction), or explode to absurd
    coordinates, depending on exactly how deep the overlap is and where. A
    single free rigid body (test boxes used throughout isolation) tolerates
    the same bad spawn far more gracefully, which is why every "isolate with
    a plain box" test kept passing and pointed away from the real cause.
  - **Fix**: `generate_world` now looks up and returns the actual elevation
    at the spawn point (`elevation_lookup`, already computed for rock
    placement) and writes it to `manifest.json` as `spawn_zone.elevation_m`.
    `teleop_demo.launch.py` reads that value and spawns at
    `elevation_m + 0.5` instead of a hard-coded constant. Once fixed, the
    *original* box-grid design (fine resolution, full 130 rocks, separate
    `<model>`s per rock) worked exactly as first written - none of the
    discarded workarounds above were ever necessary.
  - Lesson for future milestones: **any** code that spawns a body into
    procedurally generated terrain must compute its Z from real elevation
    data, never a constant, and this class of bug can look like almost
    anything (freeze/fall-through/explosion) depending on overlap depth -
    if a spawned body behaves strangely, check the spawn pose against actual
    local terrain height before suspecting the physics engine.
